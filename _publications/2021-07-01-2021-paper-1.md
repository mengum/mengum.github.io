excerpt: 'This paper proposes a faster-converging Q(&#955;)-learning algorithm for autonomous robot pathfinding, addressing the balance between Exploration and Exploitation in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Key innovations include integrating Eligibility Traces with the Q-learning algorithm and enhancing exploration policies. Experiments demonstrate an 85% reduction in iteration and training times, validating the algorithm&apos;s robustness in complex environments.'
