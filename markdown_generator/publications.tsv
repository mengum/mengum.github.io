2021-07-01	Design and Implementation of a Robot Navigation Method Based on Reinforcement Learning	Beijing University of Technology, Bachelor's Thesis	This paper proposes a faster-converging Q(&#955;)-learning algorithm for autonomous robot pathfinding, addressing the balance between Exploration and Exploitation in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Key innovations include integrating Eligibility Traces with the Q-learning algorithm and enhancing exploration policies. Experiments demonstrate an 85% reduction in iteration and training times, validating the algorithm's robustness in complex environments.	Meng Meng.
